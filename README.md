This is my first project. Trying to build the google homepage.

Easy Version (V1)

Its not perfect but its my first attempt at a project, Took me a few days as I'm new to this however I've learned : 

1) Positioning of elements using flex 

2) Positioning elements using margin/ padding
 
3) Was stuck for hours trying to fix why navbar was constantly pushing elements below, finally figured out 
Overflow:hidden 

4)Spend way too long doing things incorrectly just to find out that there's more efficient and simpler ways.
